# DayhoffRecodingTests simulations

### Rationale

The objective of this analysis is to test the performance of Dayhoff-6 recoding under favorable conditions and determine if it is appropriate for deep phylogenetic questions. To do this we will perform simulations to evaluate the effect of using different models (i.e., PAM250, Dayhoff-6 recoding, LG, and the best fit model) using the dataset from Chang et al. (2015) as a starting set. We will use the PAM250 model (the matrix from on which Dayhoff-6 recoding is based) for all simulations.  

If Dayhoff-6 recoding consistently produces suboptimal topologies, even with high levels of genic evolution, it would raise major doubts as to the usefulness of this approach.
