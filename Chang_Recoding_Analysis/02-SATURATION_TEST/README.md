## seq-gen_saturation_test.pl
script runs seq-gen commands with an increasing branch length scaling factor, and then calculates instances of saturation that occur between nodes.
It uses the simple bifurcating test.tre as input. Despite being an underestimate of saturation, it shows the effect of the scaling factor on saturation levels.
